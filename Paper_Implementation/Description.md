## PART -1: Autoencoder
# Autoencoder for MNIST Digit Compression and Reconstruction

This project implements a simple **Autoencoder** using **PyTorch** to encode and decode images from the **MNIST dataset**. The model compresses 28x28 grayscale images into a **2D latent space** and reconstructs them back, allowing visualization of the learned feature representations.

## Features
- **Fully Connected Autoencoder** with a configurable **bottleneck size**.
- **Latent Space Visualization** to explore encoded representations.
- **Interactive Reconstruction** by selecting points in the latent space.
- **GPU Acceleration** for faster training and inference.
